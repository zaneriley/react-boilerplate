# Personal boilerplate for react projects.

This is my own rough boilerplate for React projects. It builds on top of [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) and adds tooling for linting and deployment. You shouldn't use this, it's half-baked and only supports my specific decision decisions.

## Priorities

* Code quality and tooling – ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint and more.
* App speed – Server-side rendering, critical css and more.
